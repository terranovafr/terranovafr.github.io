Iâ€™m involved in the laboratory sessions for the Machine Learning component of this Data Science course, where we explore a wide range of ML and NLP solutions.
Topics explored start from text preprocessing, diving into tools like spaCy and regular expressions to extract and structure information from raw text. From there, we moved into statistical analysis and data visualization to understand data patterns, followed by advanced data manipulation using pandas. 
The sessions then shifted toward core ML tasks such as regression and clustering. We also delved into lexical semantics, including modern approaches like neural word embeddings, to better understand and model the meaning of language in data.
