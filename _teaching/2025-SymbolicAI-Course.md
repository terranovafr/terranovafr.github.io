This course explores the fundamentals of Symbolic AI, emphasizing its strengths, limitations, and practical applications. It focuses on problem-solving through search algorithms, rule-based systems, and knowledge representation techniques, while introducing symbolic learning methods like frequent itemset extraction and inductive logic programming.
The laboratory session I lead includes exercises covering key topics such as graph traversal algorithms, planning algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, rule-based systems, and more.
