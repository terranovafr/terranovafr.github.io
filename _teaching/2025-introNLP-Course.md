I contributed to the Introduction to Natural Language Processing course, where we presented key concepts and open challenges of data-driven NLP. 
The sessions provided students with an overview of key limitations they face, such as ambiguity in language, data bias, and the interpretability of deep models—before they explore these topics in greater depth in later master’s courses.
