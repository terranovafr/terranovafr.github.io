# EASSS Tutorial: Deep Reinforcement Learning - Foundations and Practical Environment Setup for Real-World Applications
## [European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS) 2024](https://euramas.github.io/easss2024/)

## Agenda

### Theoretical Session (10:00 - 11:30)

#### Description
The tutorial will begin by covering fundamental RL concepts such as agents, environments, and learning paradigms. We will then discuss why deep learning is increasingly employed to solve complex, high-dimensional decision-making challenges.

### Practical Session (12:00 - 13:30)

#### Description
The hands-on component will guide participants through setting up a training environment tailored for RL agents. This part of the tutorial will include a practical introduction to OpenAI‚Äôs Gym library and references to prominent libraries that implement deep RL algorithms.

#### Environment Setup
To create a conda environment and install the necessary libraries, use the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name rl_tutorial python=3.8
conda activate rl_tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We look forward to a productive and insightful tutorial. Please ensure you have the necessary environment set up before the practical session begins.
