GlideinWMS is a Glidein-based workload management system whose purpose is to provide experiments like CMS at CERN, DUNE at Fermilab, and others, a way to access and efficiently use vast amounts of computing resources.
My internship aimed to design and code a flexible pilot jobs framework that will replace the one used by GlideinWMS, developing a modular and flexible skeleton of the Glidein and adding further functionalities.
My project also focused on the application of machine learning techniques as support to this management system.
