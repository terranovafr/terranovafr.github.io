Optimizing observational astronomy campaigns is becoming a complex and expensive task for next-generation telescopes, where manual planning of observations may tend to reach suboptimal results in terms of optimization. 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been well-demonstrated as a valuable approach for training autonomous systems, and it may provide the basis for self-driving telescopes capable of scanning the sky and optimizing the scheduling for astronomy campaigns. 
We have developed a framework for the optimization of telescope scheduling using RL techniques, based on a dataset containing data on a discrete set of sky locations that the telescope should visit, and a reward metric. We compared several RL algorithms applied to an offline simulation dataset based at the Stone Edge Observatory, considering a discrete set of sky locations to visit and using “t-effective” as a reward metric, a measure of the quality of the data. 
Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), belonging to the class of value-based methods, have shown remarkable success in the optimization of astronomical observations in our dataset. In the full environment, the average reward value in each state was found to be 92%±5% of the maximum possible reward, while on the test set it resulted in 87%±9% of the maximum possible reward.
