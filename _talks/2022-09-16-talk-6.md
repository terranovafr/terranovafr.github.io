WheelFlow is an Android Application that focuses on collecting and sharing geo-localized accessibility information about routes in order to assist wheelchair users. Users can search for a path from a source to a destination and receive accessibility information about the path. 
The core of the application is the collection of vibration data based on crowdsourcing: route contributor users can collect data using their smartphone while they are on the move and share it with a web server responsible for classifying the data and handling the routing requests.
Machine Learning techniques will enable the smart application to classify routes as accessible or not.
