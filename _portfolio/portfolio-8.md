The scope of this project is the implementation of an index structure based on the document collection "Passage ranking dataset" available on this page: https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/TREC-Deep-Learning-2020. This solution allows to handle information retrieval in front of a massive scale of documents, starting from the design of the data structures needed, implementing scalable indexing, and going towards query processing.
