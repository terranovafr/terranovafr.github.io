This project aims to develop a software pipeline capable of detecting and classifying galaxies during astronomical observations using a telescope. The project is divided into two modules: Galaxy Classification and Object Detection.
The Galaxy Classification module is designed to classify galaxies into their respective classes based on the images captured during visual observations. It utilizes a classifier that analyzes the characteristics of the galaxy image and assigns it to the appropriate class.
On the other hand, the Object Detection module focuses on detecting the precise locations of galaxies in the observed images. By employing advanced techniques, this module identifies and localizes galaxies within the astronomical observation data.
