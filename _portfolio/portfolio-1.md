excerpt: "Part of a team of students ranked 3rd position in the worldwide competition 'Over the Dusty Moon Challenge', organized by the Colorado School of Mines and Lockheed Martin. Our goal has been the design of a regolith transport solution for the Moon. My contribution was the development of an IoT solution for monitoring the dust and regolith processed by the system and an AI object detection model to monitor the presence of rocks."
