Part of a team of students ranked 3rd position in the worldwide competition 'Over the Dusty Moon Challenge', organized by the Colorado School of Mines and Lockheed Martin. 
Our goal has been the design of a regolith transport solution for the Moon.

The challenge consisted of:
- Take delivery of regolith from the bottom of the CSM Regolith Hopper
- Transport the regolith horizontally over a distance of at least 5 meters
- Optionally, transfer the regolith to the vertical transport system if this is separate from the horizontal system
- Lift the regolith vertically to a height of at least 2.5 meters and deposit it in the receptacle of the CSM Molten Regolith Electrolysis Plant
- Embedded rocks (up to 3.5 cm diameter) must be removed from the regolith
My contribution was the development of an IoT solution for monitoring the dust and regolith processed by the system and an AI object detection model to monitor the presence of rocks.
